          <strong>INTEGRITY</strong>
          <br />
          No other single attribute of a person or of a business can have such an impact on success or failure. We believe that every action must be taken with truth and honesty, and if we must ask ourselves if it is all right to do something, it probably is not. There must be honesty in every action, truth in every word. We expect honesty from our employees and our sales staff.
          <br /><br />

          <strong>SERVICE</strong>
          <br />
          Our clients and customers have a right to expect outstanding service. We are paid not for our time, but for our service. If we expect to be well paid, we must provide the highest level of service available. We expect our employees and our sales staff to provide excellent service.
          <br /><br />

          <strong>HARD WORK</strong>
          <br />
          No organization can grow and prosper unless each member of the team puts forth the maximum effort. Often, we feel a tendency to “let down,” and to do less than our best. We expect hard work from our employees and our sales staff.
          <br /><br />

          <strong>COOPERATION</strong>
          <br />
          An organization can be great when all members are working together for a common purpose. It can be only mediocre when some are rowing in a different direction. Helping one another when possible will bring harmony and wealth to us all. We expect cooperation from our employees and sales staff.
          <br /><br />

          <strong>ACCOUNTABILITY</strong>
          <br />
          Our clients and customers must be happy with the transaction, or we shall not get repeat business. If we make a mistake, we must be accountable and make it right with the customer.
          <br /><br />

          <strong>DRESS</strong>
          <br />
          The attitudes of others toward us are frequently shaped by the way we dress. When we expect customers and clients to trust us with such a large-scale transaction,we must understand why they expect us to dress and act as if we are serious and professional.

          The title of a well-known book says it all: “Dress for Success”
          <br /><br />

          <strong>DISCRIMINATION</strong>
          <br />
          Employees may not discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, family status or disability. This is the law, and it is a good law. We expect all employees to assist all customers to purchase the home of his or her choice.
          <br /><br />

          <strong>ELIGIBILITY</strong>
          <br />
          Anyone within Dynasty 8 that is found to have a criminal record including felonious charges after the day of employment will be subject to immediate termination of employment. Additionally, Dynasty 8 does not hire any employees with felonies, or any individual with known ties to criminal organizations.
          <br /><br />

          <strong>CONFIDENTIALITY</strong>
          <br />
          All employees are not to give out any information that could potentially cause risk or harm to previous or future clients. Examples of these types of information include ownership of private property, transfer of ownership of property, clients expressing interest in purchasing future properties, numbers of previous clients, etc.
